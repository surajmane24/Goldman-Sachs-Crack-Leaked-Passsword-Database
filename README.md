# Goldman-Sachs-Crack-Leaked-Passsword-Database
Improved password Security Policies for Goldman Sachs


# Project Overview

As a governance analyst it is part of your duties to assess the level of protection offered by implemented controls and minimize the probability of a successful breach. To be successful at your job you often need to know the techniques used by hackers to circumvent implemented controls and propose uplifts to increase the overall level of security in an organization. Gaining valid credentials gives the attackers access to the organization’s IT system, thus circumventing most perimeter controls in place.


# Project Objective 

What type of hashing algorithm was used to protect passwords?
What level of protection does the mechanism offer for passwords?
What controls could be implemented to make cracking much harder for the hacker in the event of a password database leaking again?
What can you tell about the organization’s password policy (e.g. password length, key space, etc.)?
What would you change in the password policy to make breaking the passwords harder? 

# Project Report

	Dear Ma’am/Sir

		There are a total 19 hashcodes given out of that i am able to crack 13 hashcodes and get password. 
	It proves that the MD5 algorithm is not secure for passwords. 
		To make our password more secure we can use other algorithms like SHA-2, SHA-3, SHA-256 etc. 
		There are other factors are also more effective to make our password more reliable 
	Length of password should be more than 15 words.Password must contain at least one Uppercase, one Lower case,
	one number, one symbol, one special character.
		We can provide Two factor authentication to make passwords harder to crack.  
		Don’t use user name as a password.   

	Thanking you,

# Conclusion 
	What type of hashing algorithm was used to protect passwords?
It was a MD5. The MD5 (message-digest algorithm) hashing algorithm is a one-way cryptographic function that accepts a message of any length as input and returns as output a fixed-length digest value to be used for authenticating the original message.

	What level of protection does the mechanism offer for passwords?
Using salted md5 for passwords is a bad idea. Not because of MD5's cryptographic weaknesses, but because it's fast. This means that an attacker can try billions of candidate passwords per second on a single GPU. It concludes that the MD5 provides very low security for password 

	What controls could be implemented to make cracking much harder for the hacker in the event of a password database leaking again?
Make every password unique
Make it long. This is the most critical factor. Choose nothing shorter than 15 characters, more if possible.
Use a mix of characters. The more you mix up letters (upper-case and lower-case), numbers, and symbols, the more potent your password is, and the harder it is for a brute force attack to crack it.
Avoid common substitutions. Password crackers are hip to the usual substitutions. Whether you use DOORBELL or D00R8377, the brute force attacker will crack it with equal ease. These days, random character placement is much more effective than common leetspeak* substitutions. (*leetspeak definition: an informal language or code used on the Internet, in which standard letters are often replaced by numerals or special characters.)
Don’t use memorable keyboard paths. Much like the advice above not to use sequential letters and numbers, do not use sequential keyboard paths either (like qwerty). These are among the first to be guessed.
Use two-factor authentication. Even hackers that have stolen your passwords aren’t going to easily access your accounts if you follow this tip. Two-factor authentication requires you to know something (your password), and to have something (a phone with a code, for instance).
 
Gmail’s two-factor authentication is a good example of how this works: after entering your password, Gmail sends a code to your phone, which you then enter for access to your email. Unless hackers have both your password and have stolen your phone, this is a major roadblock.

	What can you tell about the organization’s password policy (e.g. password length, key space, etc.)?
minimum length of the password should be a 6 characters or more then that
There is no rule regarding use of special characters in the password.
	
	What would you change in the password policy to make breaking the passwords harder? 
i) The password must be of minimum 8 characters.
ii) Minimum 2 special characters (/,#,*,... etc)  must be used in the    password.
iii)An external Api based tool which checks for password strength should show that the used password is strong.
